\textbf{Scanner} allows a runner to search for an
access point. The better the interface check, the further away an access point
can be spotted. \textit{Requires a Meat Action}.

\textbf{Jack In} allows a runner to enter a net architecture.

\textbf{Jack Out} allows a runner to safely exit the architecture.

\textbf{Activate/Deactivate Program} runs/terminates a program 
in the runners cyberdeck. No programs are running when the runner first jacks in.
Attack programs deactivate after use. Each program may be
activated once per meat round.

\textbf{Movement} through the architecture does not require
an action. The runner may go as far as they dare until they are blocked.

\textbf{Back Door} attempts to crack passwords preventing
further progress through the architecture.

\textbf{Copying Files} that have been encountered in the architecture
does not require an action.

\textbf{Eye Dee} attempts to identify the contents of a found file.
May require beating a certain DV to determine file contents.

\textbf{Pathfinder} reveals a number of floors
up to the check result. Blocked by an obstruction with a higher DV.
Automatically reveals activity of previous runners, unless
they took the \textit{Cloak} action.

\textbf{Cloak} hides activity in an architecture. The check for \textit{Pathfinder}
must beat the \textit{Cloak} check or the activity remains hidden.

\textbf{Zap} a program or runner in the architecture. Make
an opposed check against the runners Interface ability or the programs defense.
If successful, deal 1d6 damage as appropriate.

\textbf{Slide} to an adjacent floor to flee Black-ICE.
If the runner beats the ICE's perception, the ICE stays does not follow.
Runner may \textit{Slide} once per turn, but not past obstructions.

\textbf{Virus} is used to leave up to two permanent changes in the architecture. 
Usable at the lowest level of the architecture.
