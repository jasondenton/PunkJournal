  card: A Cryopump is a briefcase-sized tool containing a body bag hooked up to a powerful pump. Once willing/unconscious targets have been placed into the bag and hooked up to the pump as an Action, the pump forces a hyper-cooled chemical fluid into the bag, draining one of the Cryopump's charges per target put in stasis (one per person, if the Cryopump can accept multiple people). While in stasis, targets are unconscious and no longer roll any Death Saves for up to a week, as long as they remain inside the bag and the bag has at least 1 HP. A Character in a cryopump bag is considered to be behind a piece of cover that has 15 HP. The bag's transparent top and gloves molded into the lining allow the target to undergo surgery and be stabilized while in stasis, which is much less dangerous to the patient. A standard Cryopump has only 1 charge and can only hold a single roughly human sized target. Refueling a Cryopump costs 50eb (Costly) per charge. A Character who is not a Medtech cannot operate a Cryopump.
  note: This cryopump has {charges} charge(s).

While in the Cryotank, they are consid- ered to be unconscious, but they heal at double the normal rate as long as they remain inside the tank and the tank has at least 1 HP. A Character in a Cryotank is considered to be behind a piece of cover that has 30 HP. A Character who is not a Medtech cannot operate a Cryotank.
  note: Requires the Medtech Cryopump skill to use.
