  keywords: hardware 
  needs_slots: 2
  card: While installed on a Cyberdeck, a Backup Drive "saves" Non-Black ICE Attacker, Defender, or Booster Programs that are destroyed by pulling them into the Backup Drive the instant before they meet their end. As a Meat Action, a Netrunner can re-install all Programs "saved" by the Backup Drive onto their deck, if they have the slots for them. If removed from a Cyberdeck, the Backup Drive erases its contents automatically. Restored Programs with once-per-Netrun restrictions and the like are restored in the exact state they were saved in, so you can't kill your own Armor to refresh it. 
  note: Programs that would be destroyed are instead backed up just before being destroyed. As an action, they may be redployed in whatever state they where previously in.
