Field Expertise:
    text: |-
      When not using other Maker skills, add your Field Experise to various tech skills.
      This bonus is included in the provided skill totals for the relavent skills. As an 
      action, jury-rig a broken item. Use the appropriate skill and add your Field
      Expertise. If successful, the item is restored to full SP/HP for
      {{value * 10}} minutes.

Upgrade Expertise:
    text: |-
      Upgrade an item by making a skill check with the skill used to repair that
      item. The upgrade costs as much as the original item. See page 148 for a

Fabrication Expertise:
  text: |-
    A successful check with Fabricate Expertise allows creation of a new item. Raw materials
    cost one price category less than the item price. On failure,
    lose half the time required to create the item, but not the raw materials.

Invention Expertise:
  text: |-
    Invention Expertise allows the creation of plans for a new item, which can
    be manufactored using Fabrication Expertise. The time and difficulty to create new items 
    is based on their price. See page  148-149 of the core book for full rules on
    inventing a new item.

Maker:
  text: |-
    When using any of the Maker sub-skills, you make a skill check using the skill 
    normally used to repair the type of item your are working on. Add your level in 
    the appropriate sub-skill to the check. You may only add one maker sub-skill to
    any given skill check.
