================
Carl is the assistant Vice President in charge of "special logistics" for the Night City
regional office of Continental Brands. On paper he is in charge of making sure shipments of kibble
reach Night City vendits on time. In practice this means using strong arm tactics to reduce the
number of vendits selling Tiny Debra snacks and pastries.

Carl is supported in his efforts by Julia Winston, vendit repair technician. Julia specializes in
sabotaging competitors vendits and keeping Carl's cyberchair is top working order.

> Julia is a Company Technician #4.
