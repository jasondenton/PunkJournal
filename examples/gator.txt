Characters may make skills checks using the skills below to see what they know about
the Gator. They learn every fact for which they beat the DC.

/center/ **Local Expert: Anywhere in Night City** /center/
- **DV 9**: A giant gator haunts Night City's sewers.
- **DV 13**: My room-mate's cousin's dentist saw it once while on a drunken bender.
- **DV 15:**: The Gator got mutated by the bomb. It's 35 ft. long, has 7 eyes and gills. 
- **DV 17**: Rumors of the Gator pre-date the bomb. If the
it existed, it burned to ash with the city center.

/center/ **Education** /center/
- **DV 9**: Alligators and Crocodiles are not native to southern California.
- **DV 13**: Every city has rumors of pet gators flushed into the sewer. 
Only Florida really has them.

/center/ **Animal Handling** /center/
- **DV 13**: Night City's winters are to cold for reptiles.
- **DV 17**: Gators need to bask in the sun; if the NCG existed
it would have been spotted out of the water.

/center/ **Science: Biology** /center/
- **DV 9**: No modern Crocodilian is as large as the NCG is supposed to be.
- **DV 13**: The sewers do not provide enough calories to support a large predator.
- **DV 15**: Pollutants accumulate in small animals, and get concentrated in apex
predators. A gator in the sewers would be quickly poisoned with industrial pollutants.

>> /center/ **Using the Night City Gator** /center/
>>
>> Use the Gator as a surprise the first time the character try to use
>> the sewers to sneak around the city.
>> After that, any plan that depends on going through the sewers will
>> carry with it the risk of an encounter with the Gator.
>>
>> The Gator can appear in the bay. It has learned that small boats contain
>> tasty meals, and are easily sunk.
>>
>> If a character is having trouble justifying a new cyberlimb, the
>> Gator can be used to encourage a continued commitment to the cyberpunk
>> lifestyle.
