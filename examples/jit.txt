Mark "Just in Time" Williams is the man to see when you have a
complex problem that must be solved in the next few hours.
JIT specializes in assembling and equipping capable teams
of problem solvers at a moment's notice. His services cost
at least three times the usual cost for a mission without
time constraints, due in advance. Once payment is made,
a team will be in the field within 60 minutes.

A typical assignment from JIT begins with an Edgerunner's agent
beeping with a priority message. The message includes a description
of the job, an indication of how much time is available to complete
the mission, and an offered fee. The runner has three minutes to
respond with In or Out. If they are in, additional directions
immediately follow. Usually, this is a location to rendezvous with
the rest of the team. But, given the nature of JIT's assignments,
anything is possible. Once the entire team has been recruited,
JIT will call with a briefing, delivered as the team is en route.
JIT usually has a plan, but with the clock ticking the team will
likely have to think on their feet and improvise in the face of
unexpected challenges. A successful team earns twice the fee for
a similar job without time constraints. A team that fails but
demonstrates to the client that a serious effort was made 
earns 20% of the fee, plus reasonable expenses.
