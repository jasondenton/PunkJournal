# Mook mode makes a character exempt from the usual rules about building a PC.
# Mooks have an unlimited budget for gear and cyberware. A Mooks empathy is

# A mooks differs from an ordinary NPC in that their skill levels are interpreted

==================================

Militech Grunts are low-ranking enlisted men and women,
usually in their first few years of service. They are
young men and women recruited from across the NUSA.
More than a few come from free states as well, lured by 
Militech recruiters and the promise of a career that
does not require skills or connections.

Within sight of their commanding officers, Militech
grunts are focused and professional. As part of a squad
engaged in combat operations, they are cool and
coordinated under fire. If they must hold a position as 
casualties mount, they will not hesitate to dig in and call for
re-enforcement. 

Off duty, they are young enough to think
they are invincible and trained enough to think they are
dangerous. Hormone-fueled swagger and bravado can quickly get
them into trouble when they are one leave and away from 
authority figures. When reality catches up to them and they
realize that they can in fact be hurt, they tend to beat
a hasty retreat.

Militech grunts do not carry their helmets or assault
rifles off duty, but do often wear their combat fatigues.
