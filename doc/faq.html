<h1>Punk Journal Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<h4 class="question">Who are the fashion police, and why are they messing with my character?</h4>

<p>The Fashion Police are a globally franchised street gang that wander the streets in the time 
of Red, harassing and robbing people they consider unfashionable.</p>

<p>If a character does not spend all of their starting fashion allowance, the Fashion Police
will mug them and take whatever funds they did not spend. They leave the victim
with a formal written citation when they do this. In rare cases where someone has 
spent their clothing budget on toys, the Fashion Police will become homicidal.</p>

<p>It is difficult to avoid the Fashion Police entirely, and it is expected
that most characters will show a ticket in their bank ledger. To avoid spending
a character's fashion allowance on toys, it is recommended that you buy clothes
and fashionware first.</p>

<h4 class="question">How do I add gear not in the system to my character sheet?</h4>

<p>The tiny, small, medium, large, very large, and extra large thing items can be added to a
character's inventory with the found command. They cannot be bought since PJ doesn't know
how much they cost, but you can use the cash command to debit your character's bank account.</p>

<pre>
found tiny thing: mystery chip       # mass .1g
found small thing: tablet computer   # mass .5g
found medium thing: wine bottle      # mass 1g
found large thing: bowling ball      # mass 10g
found very large thing: sand bag     # mass 20g
found stationary thing: pool table   # mass 100g
</pre>

<h4 class="question">How do I add homebrew programs and hardware to my cyberdeck?</h4>
<p>The homebrew progam and homebrew black-ice options allow you to add custom
	software to a cyberdeck. The homebrew small, medium, and large hardware items
	allow you to add customer hardware taking 1, 2 and 3 option slots respectively.
	All of these items work in a fashion similar to the <i>thing</i> items for adding
basic gear not in the system.</p>

<pre>
	buy excellent cyberdeck
	tag cyberdeck as mydeck
	found homebrew program: Zappy bolt
	attach Zappy bolt to mydeck
	found homebrew medium hardware: touchscreen
	attach touchscreen to mydeck
</pre>

<h4 class="question">I see my skill chip in my chip library, but it is not
showing up in the skills section.</h4>
<p>Unlike other cyberware, skill chips must be slotted after they are purchased
but before they are used. Use the <tt>slot</tt> command to place the chipware in
an open chip socket.</p>

<pre>
buy pain editor
slot pain editor
</pre>

<h4 class="question">How do I untag an item, or remove attachments?</h4>
<h4 class="question">How do I remove a skill chip?</h4>

<p>There are no commands to untag an item or remove it's attachments.
	Likewise, there are no commands to remove a slotted skill chip.
Just delete the tag and attach commands from the character record.</p>

<h4 class="question">How can I create a Streetrat or Edgerunner character?</h4>

<p>The software only supports complete builds. In most cases this is the most
	advantgeous option for a player.</p>

<h4 class="question">I want to roll for humanity loss, rather than take the average.</h4>
<h4 class="question">I want to use the Techs ability to reduce the humanity loss on a 
piece of cyberware.</h4>
<p>Use the <tt>humanity</tt> command to adjust your humanity up 
or down as appropriate before adding the cyberware.</p>

<h4 class="question">How do I create NPCs and Goons that have more or less
points for stats and skills than player characters?</h4>

<p>Use NPC Mode, as described in the <a href="#manual" class="tablink">manual</a>.</p>
