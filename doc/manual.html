<h1>Punk Journal Operations Manual</h1>

<p>Keep your character notes in a plain text file. Turn them into
beautiful, detailed character sheets. Let the software do the math.</p>

<p>Punk Journal allows you to use a small number of intuitive commands to build
	and level up a character for <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/333585?affiliate_id=33042">Cyberpunk RED</a>, and then produce a customized, detailed,
	character sheet in PDF form. Almost anything you would want to do with your character
can be reflected on the Punk Journal character sheet, if you know how to use the software.</p>

<h2 id="manual_charfile">The Character File</h2>
<p>Punk Journal character files must be plain text files. Plain text files are 
	different from the files produced by Word Processors, like MS-Word or Pages.
	Plain text files can be created with Notepad on Windows, or using TextEdit
	on a Mac. If using TextEdit, you will need to select Format|Make Plain Text from
	the menu to force the program to work with plain text.
</p>

<p>The character file describes a character, one line at a time. Each line is a seperate
	command, which sets or changes some portion of the character. The first couple dozens
	lines describes the initial build of the character. Later lines describe what happens
to the character in play, gaining cash and IP, leveling up, and buying new gear.</p>

<h3 id="manual_cname">Character Name</h3>
<p>The first (non-comment) line of a character file is always the name of the character.</p>

<h3 id="manual_crole">Character Role</h3>
<p>A character may be assigned a starting role by entering the name of that role on 
	a line by itself. A character may be leveled up using the <tt>improve</tt> command,
and multi-classing is possible by using the <tt>improve</tt> command to raise the role 
ability of the new class.</p>

<h3 id="manual_comments">Comment Lines</h3>
<p>Lines that starts with a <tt>#</tt> symbol are comments. Punk Journal
will ignore these lines when creating your character. The example files use
comment lines to explain what they are doing and why, and you can
use comment lines to add reminders and explanations for yourself.
Comments are not allowed in the notes section, such lines will be
treated as part of your notes.</p>

<strong>Example:</strong><br/>
<pre>
	# This character is for the Friday night game
	Ms. Example
	Media
</pre>

<strong>Example:</strong><br/>
<pre>
	sell very heavy pistol
	drop kevlar helmet

	remove cyberarm: left
</pre>

<h3 id="manual_points">Assigning Points</h3>
<p>During character creation, points are assigned to stats and skills
	by entering point assignment commands. A point assignment command
	is the name of the stat or skill, followed by the number of points assigned to it.
	You may use the standard abbreviations for stats, and the order in which
	stats and skills are entered does not matter. But you should set 
your character's starting empathy before buying any cyberware.</p>

<p>If a entry for a particular stat is missing it will default to 6. Basic skills
	default to 2 if they are not listed, other skills default to 0.</p>

<strong>Example:</strong><br/>
<pre>
	body 5
	ref 2
	will 7
	emp 5

	brawl 2
	handguns 6
</pre>

<h3 id="manual_gear">Gearing Up</h3>
<p>Gear and cyberware can be added to the character sheet using the <tt>buy</tt>
	and <tt>found</tt> commands. The first debits the characters bank account for the
	item and throws an error if the character does not have sufficient cash; the later
adds the item without cost. Just give the command, followed by the item to be added to
the character sheet. When buying or finding gear you may also provide a number 
between the command and the item to add multiply copies.</p>

<p>Some items come in packs of more than 1 when purchased. For example: bullets come
	in boxes of ten. When you buy such an item, you will get however many are in the pack.
	But, when you use the <tt>found</tt> command, you will get only exactly the number you specify.</p>

<p>If Punk Journal does not understand a command, it will attempt to interpret that
	command as if it was the name of some piece of gear or cyberware. If it can find
	a matching item in it's database, it will <tt>buy</tt> the item. This allows you 
	to omit the word <tt>buy</tt>, and just list the gear your character is acquiring.
</p>
<strong>Example:</strong><br/>
<pre>
	buy very heavy pistol
	buy neural link
	buy 3 very heavy pistol bullets    #Buy 30 bullets (3 boxes)

	found excellent medium pistol
	found 25 medium pistol bullets     #Adds 25 bullets
	found assault rifle

	assault rifle					   #buy an assault rifle
	cybereye: right
	targeting scope: right
</pre>

<p>Both <tt>buy</tt> and <tt>found</tt> place (most) new gear in the <i>carried</i>
location, explained below.</p>

<h3 id="manual_sell">Getting Rid of Stuff</h3>
<p>The <tt>drop</tt> command works like the <tt>found</tt> command, but in reverse.
	It removes gear from the character sheet. The <tt>sell</tt> command sells
	gear, if the character can get something for it. Both commands allow an optional number
	of items to be specified. Both commands default to working with items in the carried location, but allow a <tt>from</tt> clause to specify some other location.</p>

<p>Cyberware can be removed using the <tt>remove</tt> command. If you remove
	a foundational piece of Cyberware, Punk Journal is smart enough to remove all
dependent pieces and adjust maximum humanity accordingly. Note that if you remove
a cyberarm, Punk Journal will attempt to retain those options that can be placed in a meat
limb.</p>

<h3 id="manual_cmd">Other Commands</h3>
<p>A complete list of other commands and their syntax can be found in the 
 <a href="#qref" class="tablink">Command Reference</a>.</p>

<h3 id="manual_spec">Specialization Syntax</h3>
<p>Certain skills, such as languages and martial arts, require a specialization
to be given when they are taken. Melee Weapons, instruments, and other items
needs to be marked with what specific kind of thing they are. Cyberware
needs to be placed in the right body position. Specialization syntax
supports all these needs.</p>

<p>When additional information is needed about something that is being
added to the character sheet, that information follows the base item or skill
being operated on, separated from the item's name by a colon.</p>

<p>Specialized items, such as melee weapons, take on the name of their 
	specialization. They are no longer the base item, they are a new item
	with the given name, which you must use if you need to refer to that item
later in the character file. Specialized skills and cyberware are always 
refered to in their specialized form.</p>

<strong>Example:</strong><br/>
<pre>
	language: Russian
	martial arts: karate 6
	improve martial arts: karate

	buy cyberarm: right
	remove cyberarm: right

	buy heavy melee weapon: sword
	drop sword

	found large thing: BFG
	found small thing: ammo for BFG
</pre>

<p>See the section on <a href="#cyber_install">Installing Cyberware</a> for 
a detailed explanation of what options are allowed for installing cyberware, and 
how to get cyberware installed into unusual places.</p>

<h3 id="manual_errors">Errors</h3>
<p>If a command cannot be executed, it results in an error message.
Sometimes errors are the result of mis-entering a command. Other times
sometimes errors are the result of an illegal action, such as trying to
buy an item when your character does not have enough cash to pay for it.</p>

<p>Mistakes happen, and if your character file generates errors,
you will see a list of those errors and the line numbers on which they occured
Fix the errors to get a finished character sheet.</p>

<h3 id="manual_buildline">Initial Build Line</h3>
<p>Everything between the character's name and a line of dashes (<tt>------</tt>)
	is the initial build; how the character was created before
play begins. Character creation ends at the line of dashes, or when
the end of file is reached. At this point, skill and stat point totals
are checked to make sure they total correctly. Any unused portion of the
character's starting fashion allowance is lost, and the date for subsequent
logged events is set to 2045-01-01.</p>

<h3 id="manual_notes">The Notes Section</h3>
<p>
If the character file contains a line of equal signs (<tt>======</tt>), anything 
after this line is treated as character notes rather commands to build the character.
Notes may be formatted using
<a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/" target="_blank">Markdown</a>.
Footnotes and images are not allowed, but other Markdown notation is, including
hyperlinks and tables.</p>

<p>Punk Journal supports several small additions to standard Markdown, it help with
	text formatting. The command sequence <tt>/eol/</tt> will for a line break where it
	occurs. You may center a line of text by placing it within a pair of <tt>/center/</tt>
tags.</p>

<h2 id="manual_locations">Locations</h2>
<p>Punk Journal organizes a character's inventory into locations, representing
where there inventory is stored. This allow you to specify what gear a
character is carrying, what they have stored safe at home, and what kind of 
an arsenal they are building at their safe house. The <tt>move</tt> command
allows you to move items between locations. When moving items between locations,
you may specify anything you want as the location name, and new locations are created as
items are moved into them. Create as many locations are you need to organize your
inventory. Certain pre-defined locations, however, have special meanings.</p>

<h3 id="manual_carried">The Carried Location</h3>
<p>The <i>carried</i> location is the what most newly found or purchased
items will end up. Only the gear in the carried location will apply a bonus
to the character's skills. Only carried weapons will appear on the 
<strong>Friday Night Firefight</strong> page as equipped for use. If no
armor is in the <i>worn</i> location described below then carried armor
will instead appear on the FNFF page. Only carried cyberdecks are displayed on 
the <strong>Netrunning</strong> page. The <strong>Gear Notes</strong> section
only displays notes for <i>carried</i> or <i>worn</i> items.</p>

<h3 id="manual_worn">The Worn Location</h3>
<p>The <i>worn</i> location may be used for items that can be worn, such as clothes
	and armor. Worn items appear on the first page of the character sheet, in a special
	descriptive block below the character's portrait (if any). Worn armor will appear
	on teh FNFF page. Items in the <i>worn</i> location contribue to the character's 
	carried mass.</p>

 <p>The <tt>&lt;fasion&gt; outfit</tt>
	packages automatically place their contents in the <i>worn</i> location,
	but individual pieces of purchased clothing default to the <i>carried</i>
	location. Use the <tt>move</tt> command to move clothing between the <i>closet</i>,
	<i>carried</i>, and <i>worn</i> locations.</p>

<p>Use the <i>worn</i> location as a way to separate a character's worn clothing from
	the rest of their inventory, and prevent clothing from cluttering up the list
of carried gear.</p>

<h3 id="manual_special_locations">Other Special Locations</h3>

<li><p>The <i>Home</i> location is the default location for 
placing new stationary items when they are first purchased or found. Cryotanks
are stationary.</p></li>

<li><p>The <i>Closet</i> location is where items bought or found using the
<tt>&lt;fasion&gt; closet</tt> packages end up. Like the name says, it is a place to store
clothes you are not wearing. Do not use the closet to store current or former lovers.</p></li>

<li><p>The <i>Cryolab</i> location is where MedTechs with at least 2 points in Cryosystems 
	Operations can find the crytotank they are entitled to use. Personal cryotanks 
	gained at higher levels are placed in the <i>Home</i> location.</p></li>

<li><p>When aquired, new vehicles are placed in the <i>Garage</i>, 
	<i>Marina</i> and <i>Hanger</i> locations, as appropriate. You are
	free move vehicles from these locations to other places, but only vehicles in
	these locations will be fully stated out on the <strong>Vehicles</strong> page.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2 id="manual_customizing">Customizing Gear</h2>

<p>A big part of Cyberpunk is customizing a character's gear. The <tt>tag</tt> and
<tt>attach</tt>, and <tt>upgrade</tt> commands allow for gear to be customized.</p>

<h3 id="manual_tag">Tag</h3>
<p>Tagging an item prepares that item for customization, and assigns a name to it
	so it can be used in later commands without confusing it with other items of the
	same basic type. When an item is tagged, the tag becomes the items name. When you
	need to refer to that item in the future, always use the tag rather than the old name. 
	A tag can be anything you want, but must not have spaces in it.</p>

<p>It is possible to tag cyberware. When tagging limbs or eyes, you will need to specify
	which body part using the same syntax used when initially installing the cyberware.</p>

<p>Tags never appear on the character sheet. Tags are only for use in
	the character file. The character sheet will refer to them as whatever 
	the original item is.</p> 

<h3 id="manual_attach">Attach</h3>
<p>The most common way to modify gear is to install various upgrades. Guns, vehicles, and
	cyberdecks can all be customized by adding the appropriate type of modifications to them.
	Certain types of armor and cyberwear also allow for things to be installed in them. All of
	these uses are covered by the <tt>attach</tt> command.</p>

<strong>Example:</strong><br/>
<pre>
	buy 2 very heavy pistol
	buy smartgun link
	buy extended magazine
	tag very heavy pistol as pistol1
	attach smartun link to pistol1
	tag very heavy pistol as pistol2
	attach extended magazine to pistol2

	tag cybedeck as mydeck
	tag bodyweight suit as mysuit
	attach ban hammer to mydeck
	attach range extender to mysuit
	attach mydeck to mysuit

	buy cyberarm: left
	tag cyberarm: left as leftarm
	buy popup melee weapon: left
	attach combat knife to leftarm
</pre>

<p>When you attach one item to another, if the first item cannot contain the second item
	on its own, Punk Journal will search through the other modifications installed in the
	first item trying to find a place to put the second. This means, for example, that 
	if you install a Popup Ranged Weapon space into your cyberarm, and tag the cyberarm,
	you may directly attach a pistol to the cyberarm. You do not need to tag the
	Popup space.</p>

<strong >Example:</strong><br/>
<pre>
	buy cyberarm: left
	tag cyberarm: left as leftarm
	buy popup melee weapon: left
	attach combat knife to leftarm

	tag compact groundcar as van
	attach heavy chassis to van
	attach vehicle heavy weapon mount to van
	attach Tsunami Arms Helix to van
</pre>

<h3 id="manual_upgrade">Upgrade</h3>

<p>The <tt>upgrade</tt> command allow you to apply the Tech's Upgrade Expertise role ability
	to an item. The character does not need to have this ability themselves; after all,
	a good tech knows that the best place to keep upgraded guns is in the hands of their
	friends. The <tt>upgrade</tt> command does also not charge the charcter for the cost of
	the upgrade. If you need to charge the character for the cost of the upgrade, use the
	<tt>$upgrade</tt> command instead.</p> 

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
		<th>Upgrade Type</th>
		<th >Effects</th>

	<tbody>
		<tr>
		<td >Slots</td>

	upgrade copmlexity on leftarm

	tag chipsocket as csocket
	upgrade slots on csocket

	tag kevlar helmet as helm1
	upgrade armor on helm1
</pre>

<h2 id="manual_cyberware">Installing Cyberware</h2>

<p>When cyberware is added to the character sheet, through either the
<tt>buy</tt> or <tt>found</tt> commands, Punk Journal needs to know where 
exactly to install it. For many types of cyberware, there is only
one place to install that item, so no additional information is needed.
Some times must be installed in pairs; if you do not tell Punk Journal
where to install these items it will attempt to install them into the usual
place. But for some items, there are many possible ways for them to be installed,
and PJ needs to know where to put them. When dealing with such cyberware,
use the <a href="#manual_special">specialization syntax</a> to clarify where
the item should go.</p>

<p>If you later need to refer to a piece of cyberware, use the install location as 
part of the name.</p>

<p>If all you want to do is install a simple cyberlimb or cybereye, you can use
	<tt>left</tt> or <tt>right</tt> to specify the location. If you have a tagged
	item of the appropriate type, you may also use that tag as the location. The rest
of this section explains how to specify more complex locations.</p>

<strong>Example:</strong><br/>
<pre>
	buy cyberarm: left
	buy cybereye: right
	buy cyberleg: left
</pre>

<h3 id="manual_wildcard">Wildcard Locations</h3>
<p>Some items, like interface plugs, can be installed any where. 
The cyberware section of the of the gear tab shows these items with the <tt>? location</tt> option.
Whatever location is chosen will be reflected on the character sheet.</p>

<strong>Example:</strong><br/>
<pre>
	buy interface plugs: wrist
	buy interface plugs: neck
	buy light tattoo: tramp stamp
	buy light tattoo: bicep
</pre>

<h3 id="manual_armloc">Cyberarm locations</h3>
<p>With the right cyberware, a character can have more than two arms. The table below
shows where cyberarms can be installed into.</p>

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td >left</td>
<td >Install into the left arm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td >right</td>
<td >Install into the right arm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td >left borg</td>
<td >Install on the left side of an artificial shoulder mount.</td>

<tr>
<td >right borg</td>
<td >Install on the right side of an artificial shoulder mount.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td >tagged item</td>
<td >Battle Gloves and &lt;a href=“manual_sparearm”&gt;Spare Cyberarms&lt;/a&gt; can be tagged and used as installation locations.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<strong>Example:</strong><br/>
<pre>
	buy cyberarm: left borg arm
	buy wolvers: mybattleglove
</pre>

<h3 id="manual_legloc">Cyberleg Locations</h3>
<p>Cyber legs can be installed into either the <tt>left</tt> or <tt>right</tt>
	position. Cyberleg options that must be installed in pairs are treated
	as a single item with appropriate costs in cash and humanity. Such modifications
	do not need a location; PJ understands that they must be installed in both legs.</p>

<h3 id="manual_eyeloc">Cybereye Locations</h3>
<p>Cybereyes and single eye options can be installed into any available cybereye.
	They can also be installed into a tagged pair of Smart Glasses.</p>

<strong>Single eye options</strong>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td >left or L</td>
<td >Left eye.</td>

<tr>
<td >right or R</td>
<td >Right eye.</td>

<td >Left lens of a tagged pair of smart glasses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td >right &lt;tagged item&gt;</td>
<td >Right lens of a tagged pair of smart glasses.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<strong>Example:</strong>
<pre>
buy cybereye: left
buy cybereye: 3
buy chyron: left glasses1
</pre>

<p>Punk Journal treats cybereye options that must be
	installed in pairs as a single item, with an appropriate cost in cash
	and humanity. If no location is given for these items,
	PJ will attempt to install them into the left and right eyes. 
	If a tagged pair of smart glasses is given as the location
	is given it will attempt to install them both lenses. Characters 
	with more than two cybereyes may install them into any two
	eyes by using a two character pair as the location. Each character
	of the pair must be <tt>L</tt>, <tt>R</tt> or a number
	from <tt>1</tt> to <tt>5</tt>.</p>

<strong>Paired Options</strong>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td >xx</td>
<td >Two positions, each of which may be l, r, or 1-5.</td>

<h2 id="manual_swapcyber">Swappable Cyberware</h2>

<h3 id="manual_chipware">Chipware</h3>
<p>Because chipware is meant to be swapped in amd out, it is handled a differently
than other cyberware. When first obtained, the character suffers the 
expected current humanity loss, but maximum humanity is not adjusted.
The chipware is placed in the characters <i>Chipware Library</i>, a 
special cyberware slot representing the cyberware a character has previously
tried and suffered the humanity loss for.</p>

<p>Chipware in the library is not currently is not automatically installed
and in use. The benefits it provides will not be reflected on the character
sheet. To use it, you must use the <tt>slot</tt> command to insert the chip
into an available chip socket. PJ will then adjust the character's maximum 
humanity and reflect the benefits of the chip on the character sheet.</p>

<p>Use the specializaiton syntax to designate which skill a skill chip contains.</p>

<strong>Example:</strong>
<pre>
buy skill chip: accounting
buy skill chip: martial arts: karate 
slot skill chip: martial arts: karate
</pre>

<h3 id="manual_swaparm">Swappable Cyberarms</h3>
<p>A cyberarm equipped with a quick change mount can be swapped with a similarly
equipped spare cyberarm. Punk Journal enables this by providng a 
<tt>swap</tt> command, for use with the <i>Spare Cyberarm</i> item.</p>

<p>A Spare Cyberarm is a cyberarm with a quickchange mount, and when first obtained 
the character takes the appropriate hit to current humanity for both items. The character
is assumed to have worn it at least once as part of the installation process. Spare
Cyberarms are show in the characters inventory, like other non-cyberware items.</p>

<p>To make use of a spare cyberarm, it must first get tagged. Once tagged, you may install
new cyberware into the spare by giving the tag name as the location for the installation.</p>

<p>The <tt>swap</tt> command allows you to swap an existing cyberarm for one that
has been tagged. This causes the currently installed cyberware to switch places
with the the tagged arm. The old cyberarm becomes the new spare, with the same tag
as the old spare. The spare becomes the arm in the given location.</p>

<strong>Example:</strong>
<pre>
tag spare cyberarm as sparearm
buy cyberarm medscanner: sparearm
swap left arm for sparearm
</pre>

<h2 id="manual_levelup">Jobs, Cash, and Leveling up</h2>

<p>When a character gets paid, you can use the <tt>$</tt> to add the cash
	to the character sheet. Just start the line with an $ sign and an amount, followed
	by a description of what the payment is for. This will adjust the character bank balance and
add a line to their bank account ledger. If the character needs to pay for something, you can use a negative value.</p>

<p>The <tt>session</tt> command allows for recording IP gained from play. The <tt>improve</tt>
	command allows for spending those IP to raise your skills and role abilities. When 
	improving role abilities, use the name of the role ability rather than the name of the role. Techs and
	Medtechs also use the improve command to raise their role specialization when they raise
their role ability.</p>

<strong>Example:</strong>
<pre>
date 2045-02-01
adventure 60 Red Chrome Cargo
$2500 Red Chrome Cargo payment and loot
-$1100 Rent for Feb.
improve medicine
improve surgery
</pre>

<h2 id="manual_rolespec">Role Specific Commands</h2>
<p>The <tt>learn</tt> command allows for a Medtech to learn a pharmaceutical recipe, 
	when they level up their <i>pharmaceuticals</i> role specialization. The <tt>make</tt>
	command allows a tech to use their fabrication expertise to make an item, or a 
	medtech to produce a batch of pharmaceuticals they know the recipe for. These items
	will appear on the character sheet and the appropriate cost will be charged against
their bank account.</p>

<strong>Example:</strong>
<pre>
#for MedTechs
learn speedheal
make speedheal

#For Techs
make excellent heavy pistol
</pre>

<p>Fixers should make use of the <tt>grease</tt> command to add additional languages that
	they qualify for based on their level of <i>operator</i>. They can also use the 
	<tt>haggle</tt> command instead of the buy command. When you use haggle to buy more than
	one item, Punk Journal will calculate the best price for getting that many of the item based on the characters level in <i>operator</i>, and apply the appropriate discount.</p>

<strong>Example:</strong>
<pre>
grease Maori
haggle 6 airhypo 		#buy 5, get one free
</pre>

<p>The <tt>moto</tt> command can be used by Nomads to select family vehicles and upgrades
	for them. When selected, vehicles are added to the appropriate location in the character's inventory (garage, hanger, or marina). If a vehicle upgrade grants an additional
	choice of an item, the moto command can be used to add that item to the character's
	inventory as well. Upgrades can be installed into vehicles by <tt>tag</tt>ging the vehicles
	and <tt>attach</tt>ing the upgrades.</p>

<strong>Example:</strong>
<pre>
moto compact groundcar
tag compact groundcar as myvan
moto heavy chassis
attach heavy chassis to myvan
moto housing capacity
attach housing capacity to myvan
</pre>

<h2 id="manual_npc">NPC Mode</h2>

Punk Journal provides a special NPC mode for building NPCs that do not need to 
follow the rules for building PCs. You can enable this mode by using the command
<tt>npc</tt>. It is recommended that you place this command right after the character's name,
but it can appear anywhere in the file. By default, NPCs will use a one-page, 
portrait oriented character sheet. This sheet is designed to make it easy to run the NPC
in combat and most other interactions, while being compact enough to provide all relevant
information at a glance.

<p>NPC differs from the regular Player Character mode as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>NPC may have more or less than 62 points in stats.</li>
	<li>NPCs may have zero luck (although it defaults to 6, just like PCs).</li>
	<li>NPCs do not lose Empathy for adding cyberware, see full explanation below.</li>
	<li>NPCs may have any total number of points in skills.</li>
	<li>An NPC's skills and role abilities may start as high as ten.</li>
	<li>You may directly set an NPC's role abilities, without using one of the role commands to assign them an initial role.</li>
	<li>NPCs have an unlimited budget to buy gear and cyberware.</li>
	<li>NPCs have an unlimited IP budget, but should not need it since they can start skills and role abilities at any legal level.</li>
	<li>NPCs default to being printed using a special one page NPC sheet.</li>
	<li>NPCs printed using the PC sheet do not have logs.</li>
</ul>

	<p>In most cases, NPCs will have whatever Empathy they are assigned, and will
		not lose empathy to getting Cyberware. This allows you to set the final empathy
		value for the NPC rather then worrying about the match behind their cyberware.
		Punk Journal does, however, enforce a maximum humanity check.
		NPCs start with a maximum humanity of 80 (as if they had empathy 8). Each piece of
		cyberware reduces this number as normal, and if the Empathy you give the
		NPC is greater than allowed by their maximum humanity it will be reduced accordingly.</p>

<h3 id="manual_mook">Mook Mode</h3>

<p>Punk Journal also provides a special "Mook" mode enabled by the <tt>mook</tt> command.
	Mooks are similar to NPCs, and follow the same build rules and default to using
	the same one page character sheet. However, in mook mode, entries for the mook's skills
	are taken as the total of the skill and its controlling stat, rather than just the skill
	level. This allows you to build a mook in a fashion similar to how they are 
	presented in the <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/333585?affiliate_id=33042">
	Cyberpunk RED Core Book</a>. Use mook mode when you want to give an NPC a particular
total bonus to a skill check without having to worry about the math.</p>


 <p><i>For example: If you know you want your goons to have a total +12 to hit
 	with the Handgun skill, you can just enter <tt>handgun 12</tt>, and let Punk
 	Journal do the math to work out what skill level they should have
 	given their reflexes.</i></p>

<h3 id="manual_animal">Animal Mode</h3>

	<p>Animal mode is enabled by using the <tt>animal</tt> command. Animal mode is similar
		to npc mode, with the following differences.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Animals may have stats from 0 to 999.</li>
		<li>All skills, including basic skills, default to 0 for animals.</li>
		<li>Animals get access to special "natural" weapons and armor, as explained below.</li>
		<li>Animals suffer no maximum humanity loss, and are not subject to the
		maximum humanity check that NPCS are.</li>
		<li>Animals may be declared and built as mooks; but this is not the default.</li>
		<ii>Animals may be given cyberware and gear just like NPCs.</ii>
	</ul>

	<p>Animals have access to four types of natural weapons, in five different sizes. 
		All natural weapons use the <i>Brawl</i> skill to make attacks. Weapons are specified in
		the form <tt>&lt;size&gt; &lt;type&gt;: &lt;name on sheet&gt;</tt>.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>The <i>Tail</i> weapon is ROF 1.</li>	
		<li>The <i>Fists</i> weapon is ROF 2.</li>
		<li>The <i>Bite</i> weapon is ROF 1, and ignores half the defenders armor.</li>
		<li>The <i>Claws</i> weapon is ROF 2, and ignores half the defenders armor.</li>
	 </ul>

	 <ul>
	 	<li><i>Small</i> natural weapons do 1d6 points of damage.</li>
	 	<li><i>Medium</i> natural weapons do 1d6 points of damage.</li>
	 	<li><i>Large</i> natural weapons do 1d6 points of damage.</li>
	 	<li><i>Very Large</i> natural weapons do 1d6 points of damage.</li>
	 	<li><i>Massive</i> natural weapons do 1d6 points of damage.</li>
	 </ul>

	 <ul>
	 	<li><i>Hide</i> armor is SP 3.</li>
	 	<li><i>Thick Hide</i> armor is SP 3.</li>
	 	<li><i>Bony Plates</i> armor is SP 7.</li>
	 </ul>

<strong>Example:</strong>
<pre>
#Gorilla
Large Fists: Punch     # 3d6, rof 2, not treated as a melee weapon for armor bypass
                       # Add an attack called "Punch" to the character sheet.
Medium Bite: Gnaw      # 2d6, rof 1, treated as a melee weapon for armor bypass
                       # Adds an attack called Gnaw to the character sheet
Hide                   # SP 3
</pre>

<h2 id="manual_api">API</h2>

<p>Punk Journal exposes a single endpoint for external integrations.</p>

<p><strong>Endpoint:</strong> https://www.rpgtools.info/cyberpunk/PunkJournal/character/json</p>

<p><strong>Request:</strong> A POST call with a Punk Journal character record sent as the body of the POST message. Content-type must be set to <i>application/punkjournal</i>.</p>

<p><strong>Responses:</strong> The response object is content-type: application/json.</p>

<p><strong>Success:</strong> Status code 200 (OK). The body of the response contains a JSON
	object the represents the fully built character. This is the object used to instantiate
	the template that produces the complete character sheet PDF, including logs. Everything
	present on the character sheet is represented in this object in some fashion. The contents
	of the object are subject to change, but future changes are expected to be additive rather
	than subtractive or transformational. A good way to understand how this object encodes a
character is to submit the example characters and observer the results.</p>

<p><strong>Illegal Character:</strong> When the submitted character is not a legal build, 
	status code 422 (Unprocessable Entity) is returned. The body
	of the response contains a list of JSON objects that describes the errors and the lines
on which they appear.</p>

<p><strong>Other problems:</strong> Other API errors resultin a 400 error and a message
	refering the user to the documentation. If this is insufficent use the bug report tab
to seek further assistance.</p>

<strong>Example:</strong>
<pre>
curl -X POST --data-binary "@Mycharacter.txt"
	-H "Content-Type: application/punkjournal"
	https://app.rpgtools.info/punkjournal/character/json
</pre>

<p>Curl requires --data-binary to properly send line breaks when sending a text file. Punk Journal
enforces the content-type, and will reject a request that does not properly set it to
"application/punkjournal". <i>Mycharacter.txt</i> is a local file holding a valid Punk Journal
character.</p>
